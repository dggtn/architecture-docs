=== 9.1. ADR-001: Login decision

==== 9.1.1. Context and Problem Statement

We need to choose an authentication method for user login in our new application. The method should ensure security, ease of use, and scalability while providing a seamless user experience.

==== 9.1.2. Considered Options

* **Option 1**: Traditional Username and Password Authentication
* **Option 2**: OAuth 2.0 with Social Login
* **Option 3**: Single Sign-On (SSO) with SAML

==== 9.1.3. Decision Outcome

We have decided to implement OAuth 2.0 with Social Login.

**Rationale**:

* **Security**: OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted and secure protocol for authorization.
* **User Convenience**: Social login allows users to log in with existing accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook), reducing friction and improving user experience.
* **Scalability**: OAuth 2.0 can handle a large number of users and integrates well with third-party identity providers.
* **Reduced Maintenance**: Leveraging third-party identity providers reduces the burden of managing user credentials and security.
* **Adoption and Integration**: Many users prefer using their social accounts for quick access, and many modern applications support OAuth 2.0, making it easier to integrate with other services.
